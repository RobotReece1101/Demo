I'm editing this file in VScode and will check in localy, then push to my remot in Github
So now That I've gone to my remote.  I've opened the readme file that has my recent changes made locally.
Know I'm making more changes from the remote.
I intend on pulling this down into my local, viewing the changes.  Updating from the local again.
After all that I'm going to push to my remote one last time
